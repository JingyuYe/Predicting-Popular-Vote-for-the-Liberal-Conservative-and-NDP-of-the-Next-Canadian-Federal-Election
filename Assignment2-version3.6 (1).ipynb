    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Election and voting are crucial parts of a democratic country. They are critical links between citizen engagement and democratic representation, which provides citizens the opportunity to vote for parties that represent their ideas. In recent years, the forecasting of voting outcomes has made significant progress in various advanced industrial democracies such as the US, the UK, and France (Lewis-Beck, 2005). However, one country that has not received much attention is Canada (Bélanger & Godbout, 2010). Therefore, our analysis will focus on predicting the popular vote for the next Canadian federal election. Such prediction offers a useful lesson about elections and provides some baseline expectations beforehand. The data we used includes survey data based on 4021 cases and 278 variables from the 2019 Canada Election Study and census data from the 2017 General Social Survey. The survey data is intended to collect opinions and attitudes of the voting population during and after the 2019 federal election and the census data collects the socioeconomic characteristics of Canadians. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper will explore the popular vote for three political parties including Liberal, Conservative, and NDP based on voters’ sex, age, education, household income, household size, and whether they are born in Canada or not. Specifically, we want to investigate which party among the three will yield the highest popular vote based on the six predictors in our model. The six predictors are chosen because (1) Age has been shown to be influencing voting decisions, where people at a younger age tend to vote more left-wing (more emphasis on freedom, equality, fraternity, rights, progress, reform, and internationalism) but later in life, they tend to vote more right-wing (more emphasize on authority, hierarchy, order, duty, tradition, reaction, and nationalism) (Kaushik, 2017; Heywood, 2015). (2) Sex differences also exist in electoral support, women are less likely to vote for the Conservative Party and more likely to vote for NDP (Anderson & Stephenson, 2010). (3) Immigrants are more stable supporters of the Liberal Party than Canadian-born voters (Anderson & Stephenson, 2010). (4) Education level also affects voting behaviors, those with higher levels of education not only are more likely to vote, but they also tend to lean toward the Liberal Party (Anderson & Stephenson, 2010). (5) Income also plays a role in voting preference: higher-income earners are more likely to vote for the Conservatives whereas low-income earners vote NDP (McGrane, 2007). (6) Household size could also alter voting behaviors as one’s decision could be influenced by other family members. \n",
    " \n",
    "The three parties are chosen because they are the top three parties that received the most votes among all parties in the 2021 Canadian election (CBC/Radio Canada, n.d.). It is hypothesized that based on the outcome of the 2021 election (CBC/Radio Canada, n.d.), we predict the model will estimate that the Conservative party will yield the highest popular vote among the three parties although the Conservative party lost the election due to winning fewer ridings than the Liberal party. Nonetheless, we recognize the limitation that our dataset does not contain information regarding which riding the person. Thus, we are predicting the popular vote share % instead of ridings won for each party which may be less influential since having the most percentage of vote share does not indicate winning the election.

    "**Survey data collection**: The survey data is based on 4021 cases and 278 variables from the 2019 Canada Election Study (Stephenson et al., 2022). This survey is intended to collect the opinions and attitudes of Canadians during and after the 2019 federal election. Citizens and permanent residents of Canada, who are 18 years of age or older, are the targeted population. Data is collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews from 2019-9-10 to 2019-10-20 (campaign period survey) and from 2019-10-22 to 2019-11-21 (post-election survey)."

Statistical information on the living conditions and well-being of Canadians is provided by the General Social Survey (GSS), an annual survey with rotating content. Data collection took place between February 1 and November 30, 2017. A computer-assisted telephone interviewing method was used to collect data directly from survey respondents. Non-institutionalized persons 15 years and older living in Canada's 10 provinces are the target population for the 2017 General Social Survey. Approximately 43,000 units were sampled, among whom about 34,000 invitation letters were sent to selected households across Canada. 20,000 questionnaires were expected to be completed."

    "\n",
    "The package tidyverse is used during the data cleaning process (Wickham et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Survey data cleaning**:\n",
    "We preliminarily (specific predictors for each party will be decided in the model selection process) selected age, education, sex, household size, income, born in Canada or not as predictors for the voting responses for Liberal Party, Conservative Party, and New Democratic Party. Thus, these columns are filtered from the original dataset.\n",
    "The voting decision variable was cleaned by excluding responses such as \"None of these\", \"Will not vote\", \"Will spoil ballet\", \"Refused\", and \"Don't know/undecided\", since we need to make predictions based on the voting decision, we filtered the response to show which party people would vote for. \n",
    "Since there is only one observation of the \"other\" response, we exclude the category \"other\" from the gender variable to prevent outliers. To match the census data, the variable gender was renamed \"Sex\" and the responses \"1\" and \"2\" were changed to \"Male\" and \"Female\".\n",
    "We exclude the responses \"Refused\" and \"Don't know\" from the household income variable, since we need income information to predict voting decisions. In addition, we classified responses by income amount as \"less than $25000\", \"$25,000 to $49,999\", \"$50,000 to $74,999\", \"$75,000 to $99,999\", \"$100,000 to 124,999\", and \"$125,000 and more\".\n",
    "For the variable education, we classified the responses into three levels, including “High School or Under”, \"College or Non-University Certificate\", and \"Bachelor or Above\".\n",
    "For the variable number of people in the household,  the range of the number is from 1 to 6 in the census data, so we filtered the responses of the number of people in the household from 1 to 6 to match the census data.\n",
    "For the variable born in Canada, we classified it into two categories, if the responses show that the person was born in Canada or Quebec, then it is classified as “Born in Canada”, other responses are categorized as “Born outside Canada”.\n",
    "For the variable Age, since the highest age in the census data in the year 2017 is 80, so for the survey data in 2019, we limit the highest age to 82.\n",
    "The missing responses are removed from the survey data and census data in order to make the variables used in the study more informative.\n",
    "Moreover, since our objective is to predict the voting of the Liberal Party, Conservative Party, and New Democratic Party, each of the responses was changed into a binary response, for example, if the voting was for the Liberal Party, it was 1. Otherwise, it was 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Census data cleaning**:\n",
    "For the variable age, since the age in the survey data are integers, so we rounded the age in the census data, and added two to all the ages in the census data for the reason that the census data was from 2017 but the survey data was from 2019.\n",
    "For the variable education, it is also categorized into three levels, for all the obtained degrees higher than Bachelor, we changed them as “Bachelor or Above”, for all the obtained degree lower or equal to high school, we classified them as “High School or Under”, for the obtained degree between these two levels, it is renamed as \"College or Non-University Certificate\".\n",
    "After that, we renamed the column names of the six interested predictors to match their names in the survey data. \n",
    "We also filtered the predictor age, education, sex, household size, income, born in Canada or not from the census data and then omit any missing values from the dataset.\n",
    "For the variable born in Canada, the responses “Don’t know” were removed as they caused ambiguity and confounded the effect of the responses “Born in Canada” and “Born outside Canada” in the prediction for the voting response."

    "In order to investigate which party among the three will yield the highest popular vote based on some or all of the six predictors (age, sex, income, education level, household size, and born in Canada or not) in our model, Logistic regression is helpful in computing the probability of a binary outcome, like in our case, it would be \"vote\" or \"Do not vote\". Since we are identifying the proportion of voters who would vote for a certain party, which is equivalent to finding out the probability of voting for a certain party, we could use a Logistic regression model for each of the three most popular political parties such as the Liberal, Conservative and NDP based on some or all of our interested variables: age, sex, education level, income level, whether or not the voter was born in Canada and the household size the voter belongs to (specific predictors will be decided through the model selection process). Therefore, we plan to build three logistic regression models using the survey data to predict the percentage of the popular vote for the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, and the NDP. Then post-stratification would be applied to each of the models because it is an effective method for correcting the known differences between our survey sample data and the target populations (census data). This method partition the population into \"cells\" based on all combinations of different attributes in the model, and estimate the response within each cell using the survey sample data, then all of the estimates from the cells would be aggregated to a population level by re-weighting each cell by its relative proportion compared to the population. The detailed description of the model for each of the parties and how post-stratification would be implemented would be described in the following sections."

    "The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used in our model selection. AIC is a mathematical method for evaluating how well a model fits the data it was generated from. It is calculated from the number of predictors and the MLE of the model. The best-fit model according to AIC is the one that explains the greatest amount of variation in the response using the fewest possible independent variables. Therefore, since we are planning to use the six predictors that have been discussed previously, writing out all possible models would be overwhelming. Thus, we decided to compare the AIC of models as we are removing predictors because AIC works by penalizing models that use more parameters. We compute the AIC of the models as we remove one of the predictors to see if it decreases. If it decreases, we drop the removed predictor and keep trying out removing predictors based on the reduced model. We repeat the process until the AIC does not decrease. It is worth noting that AIC does not provide information about the absolute quality of the model, but only the quality relative to other models.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "To restate our hypothesis: Based on the outcome of the 2021 election (CBC/Radio Canada, n.d.), we predict the Conservative party will yield the highest popular vote among the three parties although the Conservative party lost the election due to winning fewer ridings than the Liberal party. To predict the popular votes for the Liberal, Conservative, and NDP, we constructed a logistic regression model for each of these parties using the survey data. Utilizing these logistic regression models, we further used the post-stratification technique and the census data to obtain weighted estimates for the proportion of votes for each of the parties. Our model concludes the following results for Canada’s 2025 Election: the Conservative party will win the most votes 35.8% of total votes, the Liberal Party will win 33.1% of total votes and the NDP will win 15.4% of total votes. These results are in alignment with our hypothesis: the Conservative party yields the highest popular vote among the three parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, we recognize that several limitations exist in our analysis. (1) The predictors we chose to predict the voting result may not fully explain all the influential factors of the election. Although predictors are selected for each model through the AIC, further analysis could integrate other varieties of model selection algorithms that check more thoroughly when deciding predictors. (2) Although we have checked the assumptions for all three models constructed, some of the assumptions for our models are shown with moderate evidence that they may be violated, so the quality and prediction capability of our models might be somewhat compromised. In future analyses, we would look into methods that could help alleviate such possible violations and improve our models. (3) Our dataset is from 2019 (survey data) and 2017 (census data). Thus, our forecasts are made far before the election day (tentatively 2025) and if voters’ opinion changes significantly throughout the years, such predictions may not be representative and accurately reflect voters' decisions.
